# Introduction


Diabetes has been spreading rapidly throughout the United States through the last 20 years. Type 2 Diabetes is associated with obesity which stems from poor eating habits and lack of consistent physical activity. It has been studied that more than 100 million U.S. adults are living with diabetes or are considered prediabetic. 

As of 2015, 30.3 million Americans - 9.4 percent of the U.S. population - are diabetic. Diabetes is a serious disease that can be mitigated through increased physical activity to maintain safe and consistent blood sugar levels. 

# Materials and methods


For the purpose of this study, a few different visualizations of diabetes and levels of physical activity will be created through the R packages such as ggplot2. An animated map showing the change in spatial distribution of diabetes will be produced using the R package gganimate. 

Code: The code associated with the project is well organized and easy to follow. Demonstrates mastery of R graphics and functions.

Data: The underlying data are publicly accessible via the CDC GIS website and can also be downloaded/accessed within the Rmd script.

First we must load the necessary R packages
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(janitor)
library(gganimate)
```



Here's my first code chunk.

# Results

[~200 words]

Tables and figures (maps and other graphics) are carefully planned to convey the results of your analysis. Intense exploration and evidence of many trials and failures. The author looked at the data in many different ways before coming to the final presentation of the data.

Show tables, plots, etc. and describe them.

# Conclusions

[~200 words]

Clear summary adequately describing the results and putting them in context. Discussion of further questions and ways to continue investigation.
